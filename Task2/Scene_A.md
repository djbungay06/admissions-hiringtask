Hello John,

Thank you for reaching out to us. I hope this email finds you well.

Please be advised that we admit students based on their technical interview skills. While we do not doubt your capabilities, we are regrettably unable to transfer you to the Advanced track based on your pre-work score. This approach is taken to avoid placing students in a class that's either too advanced or too basic for them so that they get the best experience possible.
 
Some may think that the more topics they learn, the better, but in reality, **we advocate for mastery in earlier topics before moving on to the more advanced ones**.
 
**Please be assured that our programs are designed with our students' best interests in mind.**

Please take note of the following schedules for the **Beginner Track**:

- Program begins: **July 1, 2021**
- Day and Time: **Tue 6PM-8PM PT and Sat 10AM-12PM PT (Mandatory Attendance)**
- Duration: **12 weeks**

We look forward to being with you in this program. For questions, please email us at admissions@codepath.org.

Best,
<p> CodePath Team
