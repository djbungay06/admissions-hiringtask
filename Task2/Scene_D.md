Hello Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out to us and expressing your desire to join our Tech Fellow Training this August.

In CodePath, we are excited to meet and train future tech fellows. We know that you are also excited to learn new things from our training.

We want to assure you that our team have **received your application and currently is being processed**. Before we can admit tech fellows into the tech fellow training, there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from the same school who completed their requirements as well.

This means that **we can only admit you until there are two of you from your university who completed the requirements**. This waiting process usually takes up to **a month** to finish.

With this, we assure you that we will be updating you regarding your application status **1-2 weeks from now**.

For the moment, we encourage to visit and explore our [website](https://codepath.org/) and learn from our available [resources](https://codepath.org/career) there.

Let us know if there is anything we can help you with. Thank you for understanding.

Best,
<br>
CodePath Team
