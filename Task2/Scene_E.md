Hello Jake,

Thank you for reaching out to us and for your interest in our Android University Course.

This course aims to develop skills for students to design and build original Android apps. We want to ramp you up on everything you need to know about Android development in the course duration.

**Allow us to guide you in completing your registration:**
1. First, please read the [course requirements](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/syllabus#heading-prerequisites-and-eligibility) and verify that you are eligible for this course.
2. Next, we ask every Android participant to complete a [pre-work project](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework). For the pre-work project, kindly take note of the following:
    - You will need to build a Todo App
    - Setup [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [Github](https://github.com) (you will be using these for building and passing your pre-worked project)
3. You will receive an email confirming your application after completing the process

**Important dates to take note of for this course:**
* Pre-work deadline: **July 13, 2021**
* Course begins: **August 1, 2021**

Since we can only accept a limited number of students for this class, we encourage you to **complete the remaining steps in the application process as soon as you can**.

Make sure that you read and check the full details of the course program, and feel free to send us an email at admissions@codepath.org for questions.

We look forward to seeing you in our classes.
